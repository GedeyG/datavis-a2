# DataVis Assignment 2

This repository contains the bare-bones files to start up and solve the second assignment of the DataVis course at TU Dresden. 

It also contains the sample cars.csv dataset -- remember, it contains some errors! 

## Name: Gábor Gedey
I had no previous experience with javasript and local host, therefore I heavily relied on the internet and ai. First, I got the foundation of my code from the internet (https://d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/scatter_basic.html), and with a lot adjustments and help from Gemini ai, I have finished my interactive visualization including the bonus task. I worked alone on this project.

## Local development: 
Pre-requisite: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en). Install `serve` using: 
> npm install serve --global 

And start the application using 
> serve -p 8000 

You should then be able to see your website at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). 

*Note:* feel free to explore other development environments such as [Vite](https://vite.dev/), [Flask (python)](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/), etc. 

## Debugging: 
Feel free to make extensive use of your browser's development tools! 
In chrome-based browsers, you can simply use Ctrl+J to open the browser console, which will show all the `console.log` and similar that you write in the code.
